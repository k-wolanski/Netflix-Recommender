    "Overall, the recommender does an okay job of recommending movies and shows based on the given title, although there are some pitfalls. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, cleaning the Titles makes it hard for the user to input shows/movies to the recommender because they have to know what the new title would be after cleaning. For example, the show \"Elite\" becomes \"elit\" after applying to clean function. In the future, I would like to fix this so that the user can type the title exactly as it is and get recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the recommendations are not great as they only look at the list of genres for each movie to find similar ones. In a future iteration I would like to use other features to recommend similar movies such as title, description, director, and maybe cast. "
